# Bookends

A UI widget that allows for headers and footers on lists backed by [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html), for Android.

## Download

Grab the artifact via [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/). Include Jitpack as a repository in your build.gradle file:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://jitpack.io'
    }
}
```

And add Bookends to your dependencies:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.tumblr:Bookends:v1.0'
}
```

## Usage

Bookends wraps an adapter that you give it. 

It works by creating extra view items types that are returned in `getItemViewType()`, and mapping these to the header and footer views provided via `addHeader()` and `addFooter()`.

There are some restrictions when using this class:

1. Bookends only works for single-column lists. (ie, those that use [LinearLayoutManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/LinearLayoutManager.html)).

2. The base adapter can't use negative view types, since Bookends uses negative view types to keep track of header and footer views.

3. You can't add more than 1000 headers or footers.

Example:

```java
// Create your views, whatever they may be
View myHeader = LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.my_header, null);
View anotherHeader = LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.another_header, null);
View myFooter = LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.my_footer, null);

// Add them as headers / footers
Bookends<MyAdapter> adapter = new Bookends<MyAdapter>(myAdapter);
adapter.addHeader(myHeader);
adapter.addHeader(anotherHeader);
adapter.addFooter(myFooter);
```

## Sample app
Clone and build this repo in Android Studio to see an example of a sample app. The app makes a list with RecyclerView and uses Bookends to add header and footer views.
